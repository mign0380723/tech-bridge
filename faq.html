  <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Why should I trust online banking?</h3>
    <p style="color: #444;">Modern online banking is backed by strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and fraud detection systems. While no system is 100% foolproof, banks are constantly upgrading their security to keep up with threats. As long as you don’t share your personal information, and access your bank through official websites or apps, online banking is generally safer than many people think.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 10px;">What should I do if I get a suspicious call?</h3>
    <p style="color: #444;">If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from your bank, HMRC, or any company asking for personal information, hang up immediately. Never give out account numbers, passwords, or security codes. Scammers often sound convincing. If in doubt, call your bank using the official number on the back of your debit card — not the number the caller gives you.</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 10px;">How can I tell if an email or message is a scam?</h3>
    <p style="color: #444;">Look for red flags: spelling mistakes, urgent language (“your account will be locked!”), and strange-looking links. Real banks don’t ask for sensitive info over email or text. If you’re unsure, don’t click anything — call your bank or go directly to their website.</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Are mobile banking apps safer than websites?</h3>
    <p style="color: #444;">In many cases, yes. Mobile apps from trusted banks are regularly updated and harder to fake than websites. Just make sure to install updates and only download apps from official app stores like Google Play or Apple’s App Store.</p>
