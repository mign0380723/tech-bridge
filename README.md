**Helping Older People Use Technology Safely**

Tech Bridge is a simple website I made to help my 70-year-old guardian â€” and other older people â€” understand how to do online banking safely and avoid scam calls.

I noticed that many people in his generation are afraid of using digital tools. So I created a website with basic advice, a free printable guide, and a friendly design.
